  "description": "The objectives of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA5 project are to produce and promote use of a comprehensive set of global analyses describing the state of the atmosphere, land and ocean-wave conditions from 1979 to present. The ERA5 project builds on the previous work undertaken by the ERA-15, ERA-40 and ERA-Interim projects. ERA5 is continuously updated at ECMWF, with initial products upto 5 days behind the present day issued as ERA5t ahead of review and final release as the ERA5 data, typically 2 months behind the present month.\n\nThis collection of ERA5 data has been repacked without quantised compression for use with the EDS AI projects High5 and FRAME-FM (14th January 2026). This is not a complete record of ERA5 data at CEDA. Further details of the nature of subsetting to follow.\n\nCEDA Catalogue Record: https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/7b64cf24f47f4b1aa499339c5a576be1/",
